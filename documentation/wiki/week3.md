### <ins>House Price Prediction / Property Investment Prediction<ins>

Making informed decisions is crucial in the field of real estate. 

***House Price Prediction:*** This application should predict property prices based on features like property type, location (postcode, town/city), transaction, and transaction date and act as a guiding light offering insights so that a buyer, seller, or observer, would be able to make a well-informed decision in the real estate market.

***Property Investment Prediction:*** This application should act as a recommendation system that suggests properties to potential buyers or investors based on their preferences.

### <ins>Accident Severity Prediction and Hotspot Identification<ins>

 ***Accident Severity Prediction and Hotspot Identification:*** Proactive measures and informed decisions must be taken to make people's journeys safer and more efficient. This application should be able to predict the severity of an accident based on factors contributing to the accident, and also identify accident-prone areas. These insights can be used by a wide range of stakeholders to improve road safety.

Abin Paul suggested the following dataset for the coursework

Dataset: 
US used car dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ananaymital/us-used-cars-dataset

This can be used to predict the pricing of used cars in the US based on the feature listing available in the dataset. We can try answering the following questions
1. Which clustering algorithm can be used to identify the outliers
2. Using machine learning to predict the used car prices based on the features available in the datasets


   Query: - Do we need to consider datasets with images from other repositories as well, as we are not very sure about the convolutional neural network’s application on textual data

Columns of interest(out of 61) from the available dataset
Questions:
1. How to make the customer aware of the car price-reducing fraud?
2. What are the factors that decide the used car price(like model, age, fuel type etc..)
3. What are the multiple combinations of features that affect the car price?
4. Identify the overpriced cars(reasons for its high price)?

## Title

### <ins>Sleep Health and Lifestyle Analysis <ins>

Sleep health and lifestyle can be valuable for various research and applications, such as understanding the impact of lifestyle factors on sleep quality, developing sleep disorder detection models, or assessing the effectiveness of interventions to improve sleep.

***Sleep Disorder Analysis:*** Machine learning and data analysis can be applied to the dataset to develop models for detecting sleep disorders like sleep apnea, insomnia, or restless leg syndrome.

***Lifestyle Factors Analysis:*** The dataset can be used to examine how lifestyle factors such as diet, exercise, stress, and screen time influence sleep quality. This information can be used to make recommendations for improving sleep habits.
