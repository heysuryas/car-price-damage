# Week 6

## Data Processing

There is a wide range of values in the dataset which needs processing to be fit for further analysis. 
Categorical data was encoded to numerical values and boolean values of True/False are encoded as 1/0. The encoding helps in feature extraction. 

Group to discuss on how to use the values of the columns - *trim_name*, *model_name*, *interior_color* and *exterior_color*. 
All other columns are encoded for modeling. 

The jupyter notebook with the processing steps can be found under *notebooks* tab (DataProcessing.ipynb). The resultant dataset can be found under *data* tab (processed_data.csv)
