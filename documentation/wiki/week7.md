## Feature Extraction
Following are the features or attributes that we think capture the essential characteristics of the data for the used-car cost prediction model.
- Most categorical values can be directly encoded to numeric values.
- make_name and trim_name require additional steps (like target encoding or feature hashing).
- Numeric values such as price, year (when came into the market), listed_date (which is likely to be included) might need to be put into ranges.

| salvage              | TBD     | Check if original data has TRUE values for this field.<br>In the context of used cars, "salvage" refers to a designation given to a vehicle by insurance companies or government authorities to indicate that the vehicle has been significantly damaged or has incurred substantial repair costs, often due to accidents, natural disasters, theft, or other damaging events. Salvage cars are typically vehicles that have been declared a total loss by an insurance company because the cost of repairing them exceeds their perceived value. |

## Proposal to integrate an 'Image Dataset' for enhancement of used car price prediction

Link to Stanford cars dataset -> https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/stanford-cars-dataset
Alternate dataset -> http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/datasets/comp_cars/

This proposal suggests the integration of the stanford cars dataset that contains 16,185 images of 196 classes of cars, alongside our current dataset which contains numerical features like the selling prices of cars. With the power of visual intelligence, and by combining visual features and numerical features, a more refined and precise prediction model can be obtained.
